    Growth Stocks: These are like the speedy, agile characters in a game. They represent companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to other companies. Investing in growth stocks is a bit like choosing a character with excellent offensive abilities. They may not provide immediate rewards, but if they succeed, the long-term gains can be substantial.

    Value Stocks: Value stocks are akin to characters known for their endurance and resilience in a game. These represent companies that are considered undervalued, often trading at lower prices compared to their true worth.

5. Building a Diverse Investment Portfolio: Asset Allocation for Teens:

Building a diverse investment portfolio is like assembling a well-rounded team in a multiplayer game. Just as a team needs various characters with different abilities, your investment portfolio should include a mix of different assets, such as stocks, bonds, and maybe even some cash. This diversity helps spread risk and enhances your chances of success.

Asset allocation is the strategy of deciding how much of your money you'll invest in each type of asset. It's a bit like choosing the right combination of characters for your team. Some are strong in offense (stocks), some are good defenders (bonds), and others are versatile (cash).
